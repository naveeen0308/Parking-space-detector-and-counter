OVERVIEW:

This project presents the development and implementation of a parking space detection and counter system employing computer vision techniques. The primary objective of this project is to create an automated solution for monitoring parking spaces in real-time, providing crucial information about space availability to both parking administrators and users. The system utilizes image classification models to distinguish between occupied and vacant parking spots, enabling efficient management of parking resources. Through the analysis of video data cap- tured by a camera installed in the parking area, the system detects changes in parking space occupancy and updates the count dynamically.

8.Classification Model: The classification model is a smart algorithm that learns to distinguish between two categories: occupied and vacant parking spaces. This model is trained using a machine learning approach, where it analyzes a set of labeled images to understand the visual characteristics associated with both occupied and vacant parking spots.

ALGORITHMS USED:
Image Classification Algorithm: The  image  classification  algorithm  is  used  to  classify  park- ing space images into two categories: occupied or vacant. This algorithm learns to recognize patterns and features within the images that distinguish between the two classes. Common algo- rithms for image classification include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet, which are trained on large datasets to accurately classify images based on their content.
Connected Components Algorithm: The connected components algorithm is utilized to identify distinct objects or regions within an image. In the context of our project, this algorithm helps identify individual parking spaces by grouping together connected pixels or regions that belong to the same object. This algorithm is often used as a preprocessing step before further analysis, such as object detection or segmentation.
Object Detection Algorithm: Object detection algorithms are employed to detect and localize objects within an image, along with their corresponding bounding boxes. In our project, the object detection algorithm is used to detect the boundaries of parking spaces within a given image.
By integrating these algorithms and techniques, our parking space detection and counter system can accurately identify parking space occupancy status and efficiently manage parking resources in real-time.

STEP BY STEP PROCESS:
1.	Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of parking space images, capturing various park- ing environments and conditions. Label each image with its corresponding occupancy status (occupied or vacant) to create a labeled dataset for training the classification model.
2.	Model Training: Train the classification model using the labeled dataset of parking space images. Utilize machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or scikit-learn to develop and train the model, adjusting parameters and architectures as needed to achieve optimal performance.
3.	Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the input images before feeding them into the classification model. This may involve tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure uniformity and enhance the model’s robustness to variations in input data.
4.	Integration with OpenCV: Integrate the trained classification model with OpenCV, a pow- erful computer vision library, to enable real-time analysis of parking space images. Implement algorithms for image classification and object detection within the OpenCV framework to detect parking space occupancy status.
5.	Testing and Validation: Test the integrated system on sample parking space images to validate its accuracy in detecting occupancy status. Use a separate validation dataset to evaluate the system’s performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and make necessary adjustments to improve performance.
6.	Algorithm Optimization: Optimize the detection algorithm to improve efficiency and accu- racy. Fine-tune parameters, adjust thresholds, and explore alternative algorithms to achieve better results, ensuring reliable detection of parking space occupancy in various scenarios.
7.	Implementation of Detection Algorithm: Develop the detection algorithm to identify parking space boundaries within a given image. Utilize techniques learned from the object detection module to detect and localize parking spots accurately, enabling precise counting and mapping of parking spaces.
8.	Deployment and Maintenance: Deploy the finalized system in the target environment, en- suring compatibility and scalability.
